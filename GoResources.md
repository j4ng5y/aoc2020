# Go Resources

- [The Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) - A must read :D
- [The Playground](https://play.golang.org/) - A great tool to write and share snippets of Go code.
- [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com) - A fantastic language syntax example site. I use this often even still to refresh myself on certain topics.
- [Awesome Go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) - A great resource to find libraries, tools, and additional resources.
