# AOC 2020

For full visibility and just so my leader board members know I'm doing this myself and not copying answers:

## Running

If you want to run my code, you should probably have [Go](https://golang.org/dl) installed, but otherwise:

- `clone this repo`
- `cd <aoc2020>/day<N>`
- `go run main.go -input <path to the input file> [-part (1|2)]`

OR

you can just head on over the the releases, pick your day, and download the binaries if I happened to have compiled them for you.

## Usage (I'll try to keep these as consistent as possible)

```bash
Usage of day<N>_<OS>_<ARCH>:
  -input string
        The input file to parse
  -part int
        The part of the challenge to display (1/2), all other integers (or no value), displays both
```
