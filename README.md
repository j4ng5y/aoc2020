# AOC 2020

For full visibility and just so my leader board members know I'm doing this myself and not copying answers:

## Running

If you want to run my code, you should probably have [Go](https://golang.org/dl) installed, but otherwise:

- `clone this repo`
- `cd <aoc2020>/day<N>`
- `go run main.go`
